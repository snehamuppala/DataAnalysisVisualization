In the course of Data Intensive computing, we expanded our skills in data exploration developed and enhanced them by adding
big data analytics and visualization skills. The report describes: Data Aggregation, Big Data
Analysis and Visualization, involves 
(i) data aggregation from more than one source using the APIs
(Application programming interface) exposed by data sources,
(ii) Applying classical big data analytic
method of MapReduce to the unstructured data collected, and 
(iii) building a visualization data product.

Part1-> Data Collection
Part2->The second part of project involves (i) aggregating data from multiple sources (ii) process using bug data methods and (iii)visual rending for review and decision making. 
Part3-> Code and execute MapReduce word count on each of the data sets. Map will clean and parse
the data sets into words, remove stop words, and reduce will count the useful words. Review and visually compare the output
for representative words about the topic. You may have to change the search word, obtain new
sets of data that may comparable sets of output words.
